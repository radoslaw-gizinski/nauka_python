'''
An anagram is a type of word play, the result of rearranging the letters of a
word or phrase to produce a new word or phrase, using all the original letters
exactly once; e.g., orchestra = carthorse. Using the word list at
http://www.puzzlers.org/pub/wordlists/unixdict.txt, write a program that finds
the sets of words that share the same characters that contain the most words in
them.
