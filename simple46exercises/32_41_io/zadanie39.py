Write a program able to play the "Guess the number"-game, where the number to
be guessed is randomly chosen between 1 and 20. (Source:
http://inventwithpython.com) This is how it should work when run in a terminal:

>>> import guess_number
Hello! What is your name?
Torbjörn
Well, Torbjörn, I am thinking of a number between 1 and 20.
Take a guess.
10
Your guess is too low.
Take a guess.
15
Your guess is too low.
Take a guess.
18
Good job, Torbjörn! You guessed my number in 3 guesses!
